It prints each URL visited, and a list of links found on that page. The crawler is 
limited to one subdomain - so when you start with *https://somedomain.com/*, it will 
crawl all pages on the somedomain.com website, but not follow external links, 
for example to otherdomain.com or community.somedomain.com.`,

	// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) { },
}

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
